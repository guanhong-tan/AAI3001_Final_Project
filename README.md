# AAI3001 Final Project: Recyclable Materials Detection and Classification

Overview
This project, developed as part of the AAI3001 module, focuses on detecting and classifying recyclable materials using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a web and mobile-friendly scanning interface that identifies various types of recyclable materials, contributing to sustainability and environmental awareness.

Key Features
Material Detection and Classification: Identifies recyclable materials such as glass, paper, cardboard, metal, and plastic.
Web and Mobile Scanning Interface: Enables users to scan items for classification via web or mobile platforms.
Stakeholder Focus: Designed to assist public waste collectors, recycling companies, households, government agencies, and educational institutions.
Scalable Solution: Initially targets small items with potential to expand for larger items.
